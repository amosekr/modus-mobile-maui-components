## Dependencies
In your dotnet MAUI application, right click on the Dependencies -> Manage Nuget Packages and search and choose the Trimble.Modus.Components and click the Add Package
Hereâ€™s the direct link: Trimble.Modus.Components

Add the following using statement in your MauiProgram:
using Trimble.Modus.Components.Hosting;
Then register the handlers to use the Modus components
public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
        builder
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            .UseTrimbleModus()
            // register other handlers
        return builder.Build();
    }
}
Now you can use the controls in your app.
